# Fuzzing

## What is Fuzzing

Fuzzing is an automated testing technique implemented by entering random or semi-random data as an input to record the behavior of the software in check. This is done to identify vulnerabilities that may arise during the testing phase such as bugs and implementation faults.

In addition to finding bugs, Fuzzing can be used to extract messages thrown by the app as a result of a user-input that attackers can exploit to their advantage. Examples of the messages outputed are error handling messages or messages containing a description of the vulnerablity "Incorrect Username" instead of "Incorrect Credentials".
